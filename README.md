# Kameraerkennung f√ºr den Orangenen Ball
## Toolchain
### Main Toolchain
* OpenCV (3.1)
* g++ (5.4.0)
* CMake (3.6)

### Optional
* Doxygen (1.8.11)
* Google-Test (1.8.0)

### Installation
At the moment Ubuntu (16.04 amd64) is the only supported OS.
The code can run on all *nix system but hasn't been tested.

First install the compiler, cmake (the build-system), 
doxygen (used for documentation) and git (used as VCS):

``
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake doxygen git
``

#### OpenCV

Next you have to compile OpenCV:
First install all dependencies:

``
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev
``

Create a new folder in your working directory (for example ~/OpenCVInstallation).
In the Terminal change into the folder (cd ~/OpenCVInstallation).
Then run:

``
git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
``

Next compile it therefore create a build directory:

Change into the repo:
``
cd opencv
``

Create a new folder:
``
mkdir build
``

Change into the build folder:
``
cd build
``

Next run CMake to configure your installation:
``
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
``

If there is no error compile OpenCV, this needs some time:
``
make
``

Finally install the compiled OpenCV:
``
sudo make install
``

####GTest

To do unit-testing you need to install GTest.

Download the source and install the dependencies:
``
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
``

Next change into the source-directoy:
``
cd /usr/src/gtest
``

Next run CMake to configure the project: 
``
sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
``

Compile the project:
``
sudo make
``

Finally install GTest:
``
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
``
